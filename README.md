# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Documentation

I have written explanations for problems that I found particularly difficult, which can be found under [docs](docs/).

These documents include snippets of LaTeX code which GitHub won't render. You will have to open them in a viewer which does or you can convert them to PDF using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). An example command to do this:

```shell
pandoc -f markdown -V fontsize=12pt -o 13.pdf docs/13.md
```

I am reluctant to add PDFs to this repository because git was intended to track plaintext files.
